    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 2026</p>

    <p>Yakshavahini (hereinafter referred to as "we", "us", or "our") operates the <strong>Prasanga Prati
            Sangraha</strong> mobile application (the "App"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the
        collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our App and the choices you have associated with
        that data.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Our application is primarily designed to serve as a digital directory and library for Yakshagana Prasangas. We
        value your privacy. <strong>We do not actively collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information
            (PII) from our users.</strong></p>

    <p>The App requires an internet connection (the <code>INTERNET</code> permission) solely to fetch the catalog of
        literature from our public database. We do not require you to create an account, nor do we track your reading
        habits.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. The App utilizes standard
        Google services (such as Google Play Services) to operate smoothly on the Android platform. We recommend
        reviewing the privacy policies of these third-party service providers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Log Data</h2>
    <p>In the case of an error in the App, we may collect data and information (through third-party products) on your
        phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol ("IP")
        address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the
        time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics. This data is entirely anonymous and used
        strictly for debugging app crashes.</p>

    <h2>4. Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>This Service may contain links to other sites (such as links shared from within the App). If you click on a
        third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us.
        Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for
        any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at the official
        Yakshavahini contact channels found within the application.</p>
