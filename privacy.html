        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 28, 2026</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>YakshaDhwani (also known as Prasanga Prati Sangraha)</strong>
            Android application and corresponding web application (collectively, the "Service"). The Service provides
            access to Kannada Yakshagana audio recordings, literature, and updates.</p>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. This document explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how
            we protect it.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>The Service acts as a digital library and audio player. <strong>We do not require you to create an account,
                and we do not actively collect personal identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address,
                or phone number to use the core features of the app.</strong></p>

        <h3>Data Collected Automatically</h3>
        <p>When you use the Service, some information may be collected automatically by third-party services integrated
            into the app (such as Google Play distributions or web hosting), including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Operating system version, device model, and approximate location
                (country/region).</li>
            <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> Anonymous bug and crash reports to help us identify and fix technical
                issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>The Service retrieves data (audio links, text, and metadata) directly from external sources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>WordPress API:</strong> Used to fetch text updates and post details.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Sheets API:</strong> Used to fetch the library of audio recordings.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Play Services:</strong> If you are using the Android app, Google collects standard
                platform usage metrics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These third-party providers may collect access logs or IP addresses as part of their standard operation when
            your device requests data from their servers. We do not control the privacy practices of these third-party
            services.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Any automatically collected anonymous data is used exclusively for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing and maintaining the functionality of the Service.</li>
            <li>Detecting, preventing, and addressing technical issues and app crashes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>We value your trust in using our Service. Since the app functions primarily as a read-only client and stream
            player, no sensitive user data is stored on our servers. While we strive to use commercially acceptable
            means to protect anonymous data, please remember that no method of transmission over the internet or
            electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>This Service may contain links to other websites (such as Telegram groups, YouTube channels, or external
            websites). If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external
            sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these
            websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or
            practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Service provides cultural content and is safe for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect
            personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by publishing the new
            Privacy Policy on this page or within the app. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically
            for any changes.</p>
